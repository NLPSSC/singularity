%setup
    # Runs from outside the container during Bootstrap

    # During the build process, commands in the %setup section are first 
    # executed on the host system outside of the container after the base 
    # OS has been installed. You can reference the container file system 
    # with the $SINGULARITY_ROOTFS environment variable in the %setup section.

    # Note

    # Be careful with the %setup section! This scriptlet is executed 
    # outside of the container on the host system itself, and is executed
    # with elevated privileges. Commands in %setup can alter and potentially 
    # damage the host.

%files
    # The %files section allows you to copy files into the container with greater safety than using the %setup section.
    # %files [from <stage>]
    # <source> [<destination>]
    # ...

    # %app*ÔÉÅ
    # # In some circumstances, it may be redundant to build different containers 
    # # for each app with nearly equivalent dependencies. Singularity supports 
    # # installing apps within internal modules based on the concept of Standard 
    # # Container Integration Format (SCI-F) All the apps are handled by 
    # # Singularity at this point. More information on Apps here.


%environment
    # copied inside the singularity image in the file

    # The %environment section allows you to define environment variables
    # that will be set at runtime. Note that these variables are not made
    # available at build time by their inclusion in the %environment section.
    # This means that if you need the same variables during the build process,
    # you should also define them in your %post section. Specifically:

    # during build: The %environment section is written to a file in the
    # container metadata directory. This file is not sourced.

    # during runtime: The file in the container metadata directory is sourced.

    # You should use the same conventions that you would use in a .bashrc
    # or .profile file. Consider this example from the def file above:
    
    export LC_ALL=en_US.utf-8
    export LANG=en_US.utf-8
    export TZ=UTC
    export ANACONDA_ENVIRONMENT="conda_env"
    source /opt/etc/bashrc

    
%post
    # Runs within the container during Bootstrap
        # This section is where you can download files from the internet with 
        # tools like git and wget, install new software and libraries, write 
        # configuration files, create new directories, etc.

    # Set up some required environment defaults
    export LC_ALL=en_US.utf-8
    export LANG=en_US.utf-8
    export TZ=UTC
    export ANACONDA_ENVIRONMENT="conda_env"
    CONDA="/anaconda3/bin/conda"

    # apt-get update
        
    # $CONDA activate 

    # $CONDA create -n "$ANACONDA_ENVIRONMENT"

    # $CONDA activate "$ANACONDA_ENVIRONMENT"

    # python -m pip install gpt4all

    # mkdir -p 

%runscript

    # This is where your code would go if you want it to run whenever the singularity image runs. If you would like to change inputs to your code, I recommend using the 'exec' function in singulatrity. Eg.,

    # singularity exec image_name.im python -c 'print('Hello World')'


%test

    # /anaconda3/bin/conda activate /venv
    # if [ -z "$(which python)" ]; then 
    #     echo "success"
    # else
    #     echo "fail"
    # fi
